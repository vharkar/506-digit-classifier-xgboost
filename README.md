### Using the previously created and optimized models.

* Tree Grid Search
* XGBoost Grid Search

# ------------------------------------------------

This repo demonstrates how to build a classifier using 
* mnist dataset
* ensemble classifiers (random forest, xgboost)

Important files:
* `initial-model-training.ipynb`: preprocess the dataset, train the models
* `optimization`: this folder contains alternative versions of the trained models, using gridsearch
* `rf_grid_model.tar.gz`: this is a compressed file containing the `pkl` file because the original was too large for github.


I was inspired by these other apps:
